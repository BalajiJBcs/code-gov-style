# Development
`code-gov-style` is basically a Jekyll project that includes SASS and CSS files that can be imported into your own project, wrapped around a node package.

### Run Local Server
You can run the local development server using `npm run serve`, which starts the local Jekyll server.  When you make changes to the SASS files, your page should automatically reload.
