# Secondary Links
For simple, secondary-links that appear in text use the class `secondary-link`.
<p>The <a class="secondary-link">Federal Source Code Policy</a> is designed to support reuse and public access to custom-developed Federal source code. It requires new custom-developed source code developed specifically by or for the Federal Government to be made available for sharing and re-use across all Federal agencies. It also includes an Open Source Pilot Program that requires agencies to release at least 20% of new custom-developed Federal source code to the public.</p>
