# code-gov-style
Style for code.gov including buttons, banners, and cards. Inspired by and somewhat based on USWDS.

### Purpose
As our code base expands, maintaining and remembering all the CSS class names has become difficult.
The code.gov Style Guide makes the search and usage of CSS classes easier by providing examples of their usage.  These styles are not meant for usage outside of code.gov.  Feel free to fork this though if you want to create your own style guide :-)
